## TL;DR

- Transformed an outdated software platform, handling everything from design to deployment
- Key features include AI ticket recognition, automated billing, and event-driven architecture
- Split the monolithic Rails app into separate backend and React frontend applications, added TypeScript, and automated Python scripts with Sidekiq
- This overhaul also enabled easy launch of mobile apps for iOS and Android
- The result is a more efficient, stable, and secure platform

## Responsibilities

I was responsible for the development of the entire platform, from the initial concept to the final product. My role encompassed architecture, design, development, testing, deployment, maintenance, and contributing to product decisions.

Everything shown in the screenshots and videos below was both developed and designed by me.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Ticket Recognition:** Automatically identify and process tickets using artificial intelligence
- **Event-Driven Architecture:** Enhance system responsiveness and scalability with an event-driven design
- **Automated Billing with Stripe:** Streamline billing processes with automated Stripe integration
- **SaaS Company Management:** Manage users, permissions, and feature flags efficiently
- **Ticket Management:** Simplify the organization and handling of tickets
- **Ticket Fetching & Updating:** Retrieve, update, and renew tickets using web scraping and email parsing techniques
- **Dynamic Map:** Provide real-time, interactive mapping features
- **Caching and Advanced Data Loading:** Improve performance with efficient data caching and loading strategies
- **Offline Mode:** Ensure functionality even without an internet connection
- **Background Jobs:** Handle tasks asynchronously with background job processing
- **Image Processing:** Automate and enhance image manipulation and processing
- **PDF Generation:** Create dynamic, customizable PDF templates for various needs

## Key Contributions

When I started working on this project, it felt like using software from 2002 (it was <Link href="/images/portfolio/811spotter/old.jpeg" target="_blank">like this</Link>).
They were doing everything by hand â€” bills, payments, and keeping track of customers.

So, I upgraded their system. Now, payments happen automatically, and signing up new customers is a breeze.

Originally, it was a big, clunky Rails app with some React mixed in.
I split it into two parts: a backend and a new React frontend that I built from scratch.
It helped us to easily launch mobile apps for iOS and Android using Capacitor.

I also added TypeScript to the frontend to make the code better and easier for developers to work with.

They had a bunch of Python scripts that someone had to run every day.
I turned those into Sidekiq jobs that run on their own now.

On top of all that, I made the app more stable and secure to meet industry standards.
